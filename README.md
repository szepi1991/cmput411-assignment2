cmput411-assignment2
====================


This program reads in a skeleton animation file of the .bvh formate, specified as a single argument in command line.
This animation may be played back, with variable playback speed. See the pdf description of the assignment for full features.

Development was done in eclipse, hence this folder actually can be imported into eclipse as a project rather simply, and then built and run there. (Do not forget to specify which model to load in the command line arguments.)

Alternatively, the code can be compiled and then run with the following commands (THIS DOES NOT WORK YET!):
```
make
./motionviewer <path_to_bvh_file>
```
